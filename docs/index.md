<h1> Atlantic Geohazard Risk Management (AGEO) </h1>

The goal of this Web Platform is to raise awareness of the Atlantic Geohazard Risk Management
(AGEO) initiative. Two distinct basic web interfaces, one as a search/data extraction tool and the
other map-based, are realized. Additional major elements, such as a sophisticated map-based
interface that uses Google Maps API and a managerial dashboard that allows viewing, forwarding,
responding to, and extracting data from geohazard occurrences, must to be created. A more
sophisticated implementation of RESTful API now in place, which is capable of accepting requests
regarding events based on date and type and returning the results in JSON format is also necessary.


The platform includes a dashboard with user login, significant
improvements to the search/download tool, an advanced map-based interface implementation, an
advanced RESTful API implementation, database updates/conversion, some graphic design,
integration, and navigation work.
